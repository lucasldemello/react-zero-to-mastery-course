# React Zero to Mastery Course

## useState

- One of the most useds hooks in React.
- Main purpose: 'manage values'
- We can read and update a value using `useState`.
- Changing state causes the component to re-render, unlike just changing a regular variable.

## useState and Inputs

- By linking `useState` with an input, we can control its value and respond to user actions.
- State changes are typically handled through the `onChange` event.
- Inputs managed by state are called "controlled inputs" and can be easily cleared by updating the state.
- After completing a form, you can combine the state values and send the data to the back-end.
